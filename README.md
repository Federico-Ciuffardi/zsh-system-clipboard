# zsh-system-clipboard

Zsh plugin that adds key bindings support for ZLE (Zsh Line Editor) clipboard operations for vi emulation keymaps. It works under Linux, macOS and Android (via Termux).

By default, ZLE has its own clipboard buffer. So, using keys like <kbd>y</kbd> inside ZLE's normal mode for yanking operations will not send that yanked text to system clipboard. It will live inside ZLE and using <kbd>C-v</kbd> won't paste that text in another program. This plugin synchronizes your system clipboard with ZLE buffers while it's not overriding anything. You can still use ZLE's <kbd>"</kbd> register if you want to.

It also synchronizes [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) clipboard buffers if tmux available and the `ZSH_SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD_TMUX_SUPPORT` variable is set to `'true'`. See _Options_ section for more details.

## Installation

#### Using Plugin Managers

Use your favorite plugin manager, e.g. [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug):

```sh
zplug "kutsan/zsh-system-clipboard"
```

#### Manually

Clone this repository somewhere,

```
git clone https://github.com/kutsan/zsh-system-clipboard ~/.zsh/plugins/zsh-system-clipboard
```

Source the [`zsh-system-clipboard.zsh`](https://github.com/kutsan/zsh-system-clipboard/blob/master/zsh-system-clipboard.zsh) file in your `~/.zshrc`.

```sh
source "$HOME/.zsh/plugins/zsh-system-clipboard/zsh-system-clipboard.zsh"
```

The script `zsh-system-clipboard.zsh` parses the output of `bindkey -M vicmd`, `bindkey -M emacs`, `bindkey -M visual` in order to rebind your keys (along with the default ones) the [`ZLE widgets`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Zle-Widgets) functions that copy from and paste to the system clipboard. This means that you should put all of your bindings before sourcing `zsh-system-clipboard.zsh` in your `~/.zshrc`.

**Note: widget functions that replace builtin functions for the `emacs` keymap are not yet written (see #12).**

## Options

- `ZSH_SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD_TMUX_SUPPORT`: Set it to `'true'` to enable tmux support. That way, if tmux available, every new clipboard content will be also sent to tmux clipboard buffers. Run `tmux choose-buffer` to view them.
- `ZSH_SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD_SELECTION`: Specify which X selection to use for `xclip` or `xsel` utilities. Either `'PRIMARY'` or `'CLIPBOARD'`. Defaults to `'CLIPBOARD'`.

For example:

```sh
typeset -g ZSH_SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD_TMUX_SUPPORT='true'
typeset -g ZSH_SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD_SELECTION='PRIMARY'
```

## API

The plugin itself provides a separate cross-platform clipboard API for internal widgets. You can use this API as a standalone function.

To set system clipboard buffer:

```sh
_zsh_system_clipboard_set "example text"
```

To get system clipboard buffer to `stdout`:

```sh
_zsh_system_clipboard_get
```

It will show pretty-printed errors via `stderr` or `stdout` if something went wrong.
