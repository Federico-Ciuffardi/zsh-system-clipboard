# zsh-system-clipboard

Zsh plugin that adds key bindings support for ZLE (Zsh Line Editor) clipboard operations for vi emulation keymaps. It works under Linux, macOS and Android (via Termux).

By default, ZLE has its own clipboard buffer. So, using keys like <kbd>y</kbd> inside ZLE's normal mode for yanking operations will not send that yanked text to system clipboard. It will live inside ZLE and using <kbd>C-v</kbd> won't paste that text in another program. This plugin synchronizes your system clipboard with ZLE buffers while it's not overriding anything. You can still use ZLE's <kbd>"</kbd> register if you want to.

It also synchronizes [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) clipboard buffers if tmux available and the `ZSH_SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD_TMUX_SUPPORT` variable is set to `'true'`. See _Options_ section for more details.

## Installation

#### Using Plugin Managers

Use your favorite plugin manager, e.g. [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug):

```sh
zplug "kutsan/zsh-system-clipboard"
```

#### Manually

Clone this repository somewhere,

```
git clone https://github.com/kutsan/zsh-system-clipboard ~/.zsh/plugins/zsh-system-clipboard
```

and source the `zsh-system-clipboard.zsh` file in your `.zshrc`.

```sh
source "$HOME/.zsh/plugins/zsh-system-clipboard/zsh-system-clipboard.zsh"
```

## Usage

Keys are the same as in Vim (only following keys are implemented). It will be intuitive to use if you already using Vim.

#### Normal mode

- <kbd>Y</kbd> Copy whole line to clipboard.
- <kbd>yy</kbd> Same as <kbd>Y</kbd>.
- <kbd>p</kbd> Paste after the cursor.
- <kbd>P</kbd> Paste before the cursor.

#### Visual mode

Select some text first with ZLE's visual mode to use those keys.

- <kbd>y</kbd> Copy selected text to clipboard.
- <kbd>x</kbd> Cut and send to clipboard.

> You may want to set the color to see visual selection better with `typeset -g zle_highlight=(region:bg=yellow)`.

## Options

- `ZSH_SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD_TMUX_SUPPORT`: Set it to `'true'` to enable tmux support. That way, if tmux available, every new clipboard content will be also sent to tmux clipboard buffers. Run `tmux choose-buffer` to view them.
- `ZSH_SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD_XCLIP_SELECTION`: Specify which X selection to use for `xclip` utility. Either `'PRIMARY'` or `'CLIPBOARD'`. Defaults to `'CLIPBOARD'`.

For example:

```sh
typeset -g ZSH_SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD_TMUX_SUPPORT='true'
typeset -g ZSH_SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD_XCLIP_SELECTION='PRIMARY'
```
